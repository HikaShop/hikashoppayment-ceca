# HikaShop Ceca

Ceca payment plugin for HikaShop (open source e-commerce solution for Joomla).

## Initial development
Ayuda Joomla ( http://www.ayudajoomla.com )

## More details
The Ceca plugin was include in HikaShop packages until the 2.6.1 release.

That plugin might not be up-to-date with the Ceca API ; that's why the HikaShop team ( http://www.hikashop.com ) decided to remove that plugin from the HikaShop packages and move it into that repository.

The initial developer of the plugin is selling a new version in his website: http://ayudajoomla.com/pasarela-pago-tpv-ceca-hikashop.html

Thanks for your understanding!
